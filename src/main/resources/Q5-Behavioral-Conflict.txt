1. How do you handle conflict?
Most jobs require working with other people, and differences in personalities, perspectives and opinions may lead to conflict. Employers want to assess your ability to respond to these situations respectfully and professionally. When answering this question, be honest about how you handle these situations. If you struggle with conflict, admit to it and explain how you are working to improve ways you manage it.

Sample Answer: “In most cases, I handle conflict well. I value diversity and understand that different people have different opinions, which may lead to conflict. When faced with conflict, I work to collaborate with others to resolve the issue in a way that is mutually beneficial for everyone involved. Sometimes, I can become defensive when trying to express my opinion. I am practicing tactics to manage this behavior, such as pausing to take a deep breath and carefully considering my words before responding.”

2. Describe a situation when you had a conflict at work and how you handled it.
This question provides an example that allows employers to assess your conflict resolution skills based on an actual event in your experience. It helps them assess how you respond to conflict with coworkers and how you work on a team. It also gives you the opportunity to explain how you’ve actually responded to conflict in the past.

To answer this question, provide an example from your work history when you had a conflict with a coworker. It can be helpful to use the STAR method for your response. The STAR method stands for:

Situation: Describe the conflict or challenge.
Task: Explain your role in the conflict.
Action: Discuss the steps you took to resolve the conflict.
Result: Describe the results of your actions.
Example: “While working on a project for a previous employer, one of my team members regularly challenged every solution I presented. He also had a tendency to interrupt and talk over others without listening to their input. I experienced a challenge in maintaining my patience when he interrupted others without listening. It reached a point where our respective managers counseled both of us on our behavior.

“To resolve this conflict, I had to recognize that I cannot change or control his behavior. I also acknowledged that this behavior, from both of us, was likely a result of stress due to the heavy workload of the project. Therefore, I adjusted my own communication style to increase empathy, avoid triggers and build patience with interruptions. We were able to complete the project and maintain polite correspondence whenever we needed to work together after that.”

3. How do you handle disagreements when working as part of a team? Provide an example.
When working on a team, conflict may arise between different people at any time. Your response to this question can demonstrate your ability to collaborate effectively with a variety of working styles.

When answering this question, explain how you respond to disagreements between multiple people and how you work to resolve them to accomplish the team goals. Provide an example from your experience that illustrates how you handle disagreements between team members. Try using the STAR method to form a thorough response.

Example: “In my previous experience, I was working with a group to prepare a presentation for leadership. The group was responsible for conceptualizing an idea and presenting a project plan to implement the idea. We selected an idea and developed an action plan for completing the presentation. Two of the team members wanted to hold daily meetings to discuss the plan and progress. Other team members, including myself, disagreed with this approach because the team had a log to report task progress and completion.

“As long as everyone knew their assigned tasks, we did not think we needed to divert time for meetings that would not move the project forward. We also thought these meetings would use valuable time needed to complete the project. Instead of starting an argument about the meetings, we gathered everyone together to explain their reasoning for their side. Eventually, we decided to hold a daily meeting that would last no more than ten minutes to provide short updates on task progress.”

4. Explain a situation in which you disagreed with your manager and how you handled it.
Just as you could experience a conflict with team members, you may have also disagreed with a manager in the past. This question could determine how you respond to disagreements when it is with an authority figure and how it could impact your ability to perform assigned tasks.

Your response can show your ability to follow instructions and how you approach a disagreement with your manager or supervisor. When answering this question, provide an honest example of when you disagreed with a supervisor and how you were able to resolve that conflict.

Example: “When preparing data about the success of past projects to request funding for a new project in our department, a supervisor asked me to delete data records for projects that were less successful. I knew that deleting these records would skew the results and representation of our past performance. I expressed this concern to my supervisor, but she insisted that I remove the data.

“After careful consideration, I decided to discuss the issue with the next level of management, which dismissed my concerns and supported the decision to remove the data. Ultimately, I removed data as directed, but I also changed the language in the report to clearly communicate that the reported data represented successful projects to ensure I accurately represented the information. I also documented the situation, including data records removed from reported results, in the event of questioning or an audit.

“I understood my supervisor’s decision for the request, but I could not compromise my values. I tried to create a compromise in removing the data and adding the language. We did eventually receive funding for our project based on the reports.”

5. Describe a situation in which you disagreed with a rule or policy and how you handled it.
In previous positions, you may have encountered guidelines that you didn’t feel comfortable following. This question allows you to explain why or why not you would perform assigned tasks even when you disagree with the rule or policy related to the duty.

To answer this question, provide an example of a rule or policy that you disagreed with, how you expressed your disagreement and how you reconciled the disagreement to ensure you could perform your duties as assigned.

Example: “In one of my previous jobs, the human resources director wanted to capture personal identifying information—such as social security numbers—on job applications. He was insistent that the information would be secure, and though I believed him, I still disagreed with this practice. I understood that human resources needed to collect this information at the point of hire to verify employment eligibility, but I did not agree with collecting it from every applicant.

“I expressed my opinion that requiring this information on the application could negatively impact our talent pool, but also acknowledged that I was not a human resources professional and it was not my decision. The human resources director acknowledged my opinion, but believed it was the best practice. I trusted him as the experienced professional to make the correct choice.”

1. How do you respond when you disagree with a coworker?
There may be a time when you and a coworker have different ideas about how to execute a task. The hiring manager may ask this interview question because they're interested in learning about your ability to collaborate with other team members. By asking this question, the interviewer hopes to gain insight into how you handle challenging situations in the workplace, so focus on highlighting how you have resolved an issue with a coworker in the past.

In your answer, use the STAR method to outline your response. This acronym, which stands for "situation, task, action and result," is a guide for answering behavioral interview questions with sufficient detail about the example you're referring to and how you addressed it successfully.

Example: "During a new project last year, one of my team members suggested we used a method of coding that I found inefficient. In this situation, I met with my team member one-on-one as we each laid out our plans for the project and the coding method we found most useful. After our discussion, we both understood each other's suggestions and presented our ideas to the rest of the team, which allowed everyone to voice their opinions. We were able to come to a mutual decision as a group."

2. Tell me about a time you had multiple responsibilities to manage. How did you respond to this situation?
As a software engineer, you may have many tasks to manage at once, and the interviewer may ask this question to see how you would perform in a busy environment. This question provides you with an opportunity to talk about your effective time management skills and your ability to remain flexible while adapting to new responsibilities. Consider using the STAR method to discuss a time when you dealt with multiple responsibilities in a professional setting and address how you reacted.

Example: "Last summer, my manager assigned me to a performance interface design team at the same time I was working on coordinating software installation for a client. While at first I was overwhelmed with having two big projects at once, I dedicated a day to organizing and prioritizing which tasks needed attention first so that I could meet the deadlines for both assignments. Because of this, I was able to turn in both assignments on time."

3. Can you give me an example of how you set goals for yourself?
Hiring managers may ask this question if they're interested in learning how you set career-oriented goals that are both ambitious and achievable. Setting goals is an important part of your job as a software engineer because it shows your commitment to excellence at your job . Consider answering this question by explaining a time you set a goal and how you accomplished it.

Example: "With my last employer, I realized I wanted to advance from my entry-level position on a software innovation team to a role as a programmer analyst. Programmer analysts typically have three to five years of experience, and I knew that six months after I realized this goal, I would reach my third anniversary with the company. This made promotion a challenging but attainable goal. I put in long hours and worked one-on-one with my supervisor, and on my three-year anniversary, I successfully achieved the position of programmer analyst."

4. In your opinion, what are some principles every software engineer should follow?
The interviewer is likely to ask this question to evaluate your diligence in your job and how you'd meet or exceed the expectations of the company. Consider mentioning the value of adaptability or resourcefulness, as these qualities are useful in many professional settings. You can also discuss your personal coding philosophy and overall thoughts about software engineering.

Example: "One principle that I try to follow as a software engineer is to keep things simple and straightforward. The work itself can be technical and complicated, so I find that a simple and effective system for coding and task execution allows me to stay focused on complex tasks without becoming overwhelmed."

5. What is the most helpful feedback you've ever gotten about yourself?
Constructive criticism can be helpful for your overall professional growth, so consider answering this question with a piece of criticism you received and how it helped you improve your work. You can show your ability to react positively to constructive criticism and demonstrate that you're willing to learn and progress.

Example: "A year ago, my manager called me into her office and gave me some critical feedback that I wasn't expecting. However, I am so glad that she pointed out a flaw in my organizational methods so that I could reevaluate my approach. While I didn't realize it at the time, her criticism helped me challenge myself and improve my work without requiring me to work longer hours."

6. Tell me about a time you were new to a situation or environment. How did you adapt?
This question allows you to show your ability to take on responsibilities that are not included in your job description, such as independent research and how you adapt to dynamic work environments. If you are unsure how to answer this question, consider describing your experience starting your previous job.

Example: "When I started my last job, I had never worked as a full-time software engineer and knew that I had a lot to learn. However, I made sure to ask many questions and take notes about what I learned, reviewing them at the end of each workday. Eventually, I became familiar with the systems and protocol and exceeded my goals within the first six months of employment."

7. As a software engineer, you must be both predictable and innovative. How can these traits coexist in your work?
By asking this question, the interviewer is likely trying to assess your ability to balance consistency with creativity and gain an understanding of your philosophy toward your work. Try to provide an answer that's true to your philosophy but also reflects the values of the company with which you're interviewing.

Example: "I believe that the balance of predictability and innovation is the foundation of my work as a software engineer. It's important that my team delivers high-quality software within a predictable time frame, but our everyday work requires us to be innovative and develop alternative systems and processes. From my experience, it is an engineer's ability to balance predictability and innovation that leads to their success and potential to be an effective team member."

8. Tell me about a time you needed information from someone who wasn't responsive. How did you handle it?
If the hiring manager asks you this question during an interview, try to highlight your communication skills and your ability to handle challenges with your coworkers. The hiring manager may want to see your level of understanding toward your colleague's perspective in the situation, so emphasize your ability to be considerate of others while obtaining the information you need.

Example: "I was in a situation at my previous job where I was organizing a plan of action for my team, and the deadline was rapidly approaching. My manager expressed that she was busy with several projects at the time and couldn't respond to my emails until two to three days later. Rather than getting frustrated, I asked my team members for input, and we created a fully formed plan that we then presented to my manager, who approved it immediately."

9. What are your organizational strategies?
When answering this question, be honest and reflect on what strategies have worked for you in the past. Discuss which methods were the most successful and why, and show that you understand your own work style and best practices. You can explain your time management strategies and give past examples.

Example: "Over the years, I've found that I perform the best at work when I'm the most organized. For this reason, I have developed a variety of strategies to make sure that I'm managing my time and projects accordingly. For example, I use time management applications on my phone that help me stay focused, and I limit multitasking when possible so that I remain concentrated on one task until I fully execute it."

10. How do you deal with unexpected changes to deadlines?
Interviewers use this question to assess how you react to time-sensitive projects and how well you work under pressure. In your response, highlight your ability to react quickly without sacrificing quality, and emphasize strategies that have helped you adapt to changes in your previous work experience.

Example: "Last April, my manager assigned me to increase a software's efficiency by 3% in 30 days. However, the deadline changed a few days later, and I only had two weeks to complete the task. While I was a little nervous about my ability to complete the task in time, I asked fellow team members for their advice and learned a new strategy that allowed me to increase software efficiency by 4% and exceed my goal in two weeks."
